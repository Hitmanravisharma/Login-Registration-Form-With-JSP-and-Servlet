Database connectivity in java using JDBC MYSQL.
Firstly we take input from the user by using the index.html file after this step we send that data to the GfgRegister.java file which is a servlet file. In Servlet we have connected our Mysql database by using the MySQL jar file. If there is no error in input then data will be inserted into our database table and we will get the message of successful insertion of data.
